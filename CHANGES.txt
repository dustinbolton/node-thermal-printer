Added getInterface()
Added command codes for ABS toggling for Epson & Star
Added command codes for getting current status overview, offline status details, error details, and paper status for Epson & Star
Added bidirectional ability allowing reading of information from printer such as status (online/offline, ready to print, out of paper, jam, etc)
Added function for turning ABS on or off with callbacks on status changes
Added functions for getting various status information
Added configuration codes for Epson & Star printers for status retrieval and auto status back enabling/disabling
Added optional callback to init() to catch errors opening printer.
init() now opens connection to printer immediately and holds open.
Added disconnect() function to disconnect from printer. Undoes init().
Modified write-file-queue package to support file descriptors.
Renamed forked write-file-queue to write-file-queue-fd to prevent accidental overwrite as original package is no longer compatible. Appears fairly abandoned so should be fine.
On execute() and raw() if fd not set then wait 1sec and try again.

NOTE: asb() and getStatus() not yet available for IP printers.
